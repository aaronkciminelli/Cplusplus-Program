# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project requried using c++ in visual studio. It needed to intigrate a python code. I had to create a program that would Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I created a c++ code that called on a python program pretty well. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could enhance my code in the python section. By doing this it will not only imporve my c++ skills but also my python language skills. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
the most chalenging peice to write was the histogram. I did not know what it was or what it meant, so i had to do some through research on how to code that particular section. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think my reasearch and troubleshooting skills will be particularly trasnferable. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
i made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the code clean and recycleable. I also added many comments that would allow me to read and understand my code if i were to come back and read it later.
